A Simple Unity 2D Game
======================

This repository contains my simple learning excersize using Unity 2D.
The game has few sprite animations, background objects and C# scripts.
The game has support for touch and keyboard actions.
Note that if you build the game yourself the jumpforce value 150 needs to be changed for keyboard build to 400 at Unity editor.

Note that this game is not a ready product for release. It's a learning excersize.
